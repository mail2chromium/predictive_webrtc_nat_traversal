# predictive_webrtc_nat_traversal
This project pioneers a `predictive model` to boost WebRTC performance by **optimizing** NAT traversal. By addressing `latency` issues and predicting `optimal data` pathways, I facilitate smoother, faster, and more efficient WebRTC communications, thus elevating peer-to-peer interactions.
